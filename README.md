[![BotInvite](https://img.shields.io/badge/Invite%20bot-Click%20here-ff69b4.svg "Invite the bot to your server")](https://bit.ly/ZetaNotifs) [![ServerInvite](https://img.shields.io/badge/Join%20Test%20Server-Click%20here-success.svg "This is where you can test the bot")](https://discord.gg/3YM9cPq)

**As of now I will be hosting the bot. Invite it with the button above. If I am unable to host it in the future, I will update this README.**

This bot was created by in order to notify users when a high-rarity waifu is spawned by WaifuBot. Additionally, the bot lists the rarity of each Waifu that spawns.


When a Zeta/pink waifu spawns, this bot will mention a user, role, or ping specified by the owner of the server.

### Server Setup)


To set the person who will be notified when a Zeta spawns, use 

```
z!setping <ping>
```
 
The ping can be a role, a single user, or @everyone/@here.

### Examples

###### User

###### Roles

The first thing you should do is create a role with this permission enabled:

After that, you can use the z!setping command again.

###### Other Pings

```
z!setrole @everyone
```

```
z!setrole @here
```

**In order to ping more than one user you need to create a role!**

### Normal Spawns

The bot will comment on the rarity of all the spawns in each server it is in. Below are a few examples.

### Self Hosting the Bot

This bot is made with discord.py, so we will need to set up an environment to run the bot in.
